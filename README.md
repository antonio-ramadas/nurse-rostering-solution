# Nurse Rostering Solution

As a project for [Methodologies for Planning and Scheduling](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~eol/PRODEI/mpe1617_eng.htm) it has been developed an attempt to solve the widely known Nurse Rostering Problem as stated in [The Second International Nurse Rostering Competition](http://mobiz.vives.be/inrc2/). A paper detailing the approach has also been produced. The working group chose C++ as the programming language due to its versatility.
